Я продублирую ответ на 2 задание и тут:
Answer the questions
Given bracket sequence: [((())()(())]]
//Can this sequence be considered correct?
//My answer: No.

//If the answer to the previous question is “no”, then what needs to be changed in it to make it correct?
//My answer: we need to change this sequence as follows: [( (()) () (()) )]. I removed one closing square bracket and added one closing parenthesis.
